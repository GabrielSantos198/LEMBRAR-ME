# LEMBRAR-ME üìä
Life is full of commitments and we can't always remember them all, thinking about it I decided to develop LEMBRAR-ME, an online, secure and open source platform where you can easily create reminders in an organized way, so you'll never forget of something important and to better serve you, I have always sought innovation and improvement in the system, in addition to being available to answer questions and receive suggestions through the forms of contact presented here.

* ## Privacyüîí
  * REMEMBER ME values your privacy very much, so your information and everything written here will be just between you and the server, no one else will have access.
  
* ## Practicality üëå
  * Website with an extremely modern and simple to use interface. Just log in and start taking notes. Without any complications.
  
* ## Safety üõ°
  * The best security techniques available on the market were used on this platform. No wonder many consider safety to be our middle name.
